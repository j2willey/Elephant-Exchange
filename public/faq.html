            <h2>🏆 The Golden Rules of Hosting</h2>
            
            <h3>1. The TV is for Status, Not Focus</h3>
            <p>Connect a laptop to a TV or Projector visible to the room. This is your "Flight Board." It lets people see who holds the Espresso Machine without having to shout across the room. It keeps the introverts engaged because they can plan their move silently.</p>

            <h3>2. Use the "Mobile Upload" Feature</h3>
            <p>If someone opens a gift that is small (like a gift card) or detailed (like a book), ask them to take a photo using the mobile link. It appears on the TV instantly. This prevents the "What is that?" confusion from the back of the room.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't enter names manually! Send the Game Link to your guests. They can add their own names to the roster while they eat appetizers.

            <h2>⚙️ Managing the Game Flow</h2>

            <h3>Handling "The Stall"</h3>
            <p>In large games, the middle turns can drag. Use the <strong>Turn Timer</strong> (default 60s) to keep a friendly pressure. The sound effects help signal that "Time is Money!"</p>

            <h3>The "3-Steal" Lock</h3>
            <p>To prevent the game from lasting forever, this app locks a gift after it has been stolen 3 times. The 3rd person to steal it keeps it. The app handles this math for you—if the "Steal" button is gone, the gift is safe.</p>

            <h3>The "Frozen" Victim</h3>
            <p>If Alice steals from Bob, Bob cannot immediately steal the same gift back. This is the "No Take-Backs" rule. Bob must steal from someone else or open a new gift. The app enforces this automatically.</p>

            <h2>🗳️ The End Game: Worst Gift Voting</h2>
            
            <h3>Why do it?</h3>
            <p>Every White Elephant has "That One Gift" (at least one) —the creepy doll, the half-eaten fruitcake, the singing fish. Instead of letting the person stuck with it feel bad, turn it into a competition!</p>
            
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>When you click <strong>End Game</strong>, choose "Enable Voting." Guests use their phones to thumb-down the gifts they would least want. The results appear live on the TV.</p>
            <p>Guests can downvote the "Worst" (or funniest) gift. Watch the bar chart grow live on the TV. It's a great way to end the night with one last laugh.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Host Tip: The "Consolation" Prize</strong><br>
                Buy 1 or 2 small, genuinely good gifts (chocolate, gift card). Keep them hidden. After the voting, award these to the "Winners" of the Worst Gift vote. It turns a "loss" into a win and ends the party on a high note!
